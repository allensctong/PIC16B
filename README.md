### Project Description

In this project, we will use reinforcement learning to train an AI to play the gambling game BlackJack, with the goal of discovering advanced strategies for winning the game. We plan to compare the performance of two different reinforcement learning algorithms in training an AI to play the gambling game BlackJack. We started by using openAI gym “blackjack” environment but realized that it’s a simpler version where the action space is fixed and player can only “hit” or “stand”.  The goal of the project is to evaluate which algorithm can discover advanced strategies for winning the game more effectively. By comparing the performance of the three agents, we will identify which algorithm is most effective in learning optimal strategies for playing BlackJack. The process involves defining the game's state and action spaces, and then training an agent to take actions that maximize the expected cumulative reward over time. The reinforcement learning algorithm updates the agent's policy or decision-making function based on the feedback received, and over time, the agent improves its decision-making process to maximize its reward.

### Ethics

Some potential groups that might benefit from this model include game developers, casino operators, and researchers. Developing a model like this could help the game developers to consider how to balance the game based on what the winning strategy this model came up with. Additionally, casino operators might be able to use this model to adjust their system to maximize their profit. Lastly, the researchers who study game theories might find this model helpful in being able to detect patterns that aren’t so obvious.

One group that could be harmed by this project is individuals with gambling addiction, who may be further incentivized to gamble. To avoid this, we could change our repository to private after the project is over to prevent problem gamblers from using it to continue their gambling activity. Additionally, we could still provide helpful information to authorized groups who might need this model for justified uses.

Having closely examined the ethical implications, we hold the belief that creating our product yields a greater number of benefits than drawbacks. This conclusion is predicated on the following two underlying assumptions. One of the assumptions is that gambling is an industry central to the Indigenous American economy, it can help economic growth and preserve indigenous reservations and cultures. According to [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2022/05/20/native-american-casinos-gaming-gambling-tribal-rights-free-speech-fbi-us-government-indians/9655379002/), there are 527 casinos operated by 247 indigenous tribes in 2020, with an estimated $33 billion in revenue. According to the [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/digest/feb03/social-and-economic-impact-native-american-casinos), the gambling industry fueled 11.5% population growth and 26% employment increase. Since indigenous reservations are often located in remote areas away from economic centers, our product can help grow their economy that’s already challenged and help preserve indigenous culture.

Another assumption is that the product can be used as an educational tool for teenagers to stay away from gambling. As ChatGPT has become a useful tool in many people’s daily lives, it should come as no surprise that the casinos can use AI products like ours to tweak the games to increase their revenue. A gambler may win some in the beginning as the casinos lure the gambler into spending more, but soon one will start to lose since our product has mastered all rules of the game. Therefore, making teenagers aware that gambling is and will never be a fair game can reduce the gambling population.
