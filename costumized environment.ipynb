    "    Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to beat the dealer by obtaining cards\n",
    "    that sum to closer to 21 (without going over 21) than the dealers cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Description\n",
    "    Card Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) have a point value of 10.\n",
    "    - Aces can either count as 11 (called a 'usable ace') or 1.\n",
    "    - Numerical cards (2-9) have a value equal to their number.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This game is played with an infinite deck (or with replacement).\n",
    "    The game starts with the dealer having one face up and one face down card,\n",
    "    while the player has two face up cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The player can request additional cards (hit, action=1) until they decide to stop (stick, action=0)\n",
    "    or exceed 21 (bust, immediate loss).\n",
    "    After the player sticks, the dealer reveals their facedown card, and draws\n",
    "    until their sum is 17 or greater.  If the dealer goes bust, the player wins.\n",
    "    If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the outcome (win, lose, draw) is\n",
    "    decided by whose sum is closer to 21.\n",
    "    ### Action Space\n",
    "    There are two actions: stick (0), and hit (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Observation Space\n",
    "    The observation consists of a 3-tuple containing: the player's current sum,\n",
    "    the value of the dealer's one showing card (1-10 where 1 is ace),\n",
    "    and whether the player holds a usable ace (0 or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "    This environment corresponds to the version of the blackjack problem\n",
    "    described in Example 5.1 in Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction\n",
    "    by Sutton and Barto (http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Rewards\n",
    "    - win game: +1\n",
    "    - lose game: -1\n",
    "    - draw game: 0\n",
    "    - win game with natural blackjack:\n",
    "\n",
    "        +1.5 (if <a href=\"#nat\">natural</a> is True)\n",
    "\n",
    "        +1 (if <a href=\"#nat\">natural</a> is False)\n",

    "    If the player achieves a natural blackjack and the dealer does not, the player\n",
    "    will win (i.e. get a reward of +1). The reverse rule does not apply.\n",
    "    If both the player and the dealer get a natural, it will be a draw (i.e. reward 0).\n",
